# CTRE Phoenix library for Rust
This crate contains a port of the high-level CTRE Phoenix library.

This currently only supports motor controllers.

This project is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Cross the Road Electronics.

## What is this `gen` directory?
The `gen` directory holds a couple of files that helped generate a starting point for everything.

The `gen_mot.j2` and `hooks.py` were used with [header2whatever](https://github.com/virtuald/header2whatever)
to quickly generate an initial motor control module.

## How do I actually use this?
Beats me.

## Does this actually work?
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
